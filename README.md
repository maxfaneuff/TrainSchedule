# TrainSchedule
A repo for the Train Schedule homework

<h1>The Train Schedule Homework</h1>
<h5>My attempt at the train schedule assignment</h5>

<h2>What This Page is About</h2>
<h5>I chose to do this assignment because I needed to practice the moment.js stuff, and because I wanted to move on quickly to the group project.  I'm still not totally comfortable with the moment.js stuff, but I got it enough to get the assignment done.  I also got some good practice w/ more advanced Bootstrap behaviors</h5>

<h2>How This Page Works</h2>
<h5>On load, the JS goes to my Firebase and appends the info of each child to the train schedule table.  When a new train is added, the #submit.on("click") function grabs the values of the text fields, and enters them as new children in Firebase.  The same function that runs at page load runs when new children get added, so the append process repeats itself.</h5>

<h2>Bugs and Issues/Things With Which I Struggled</h2>
<h5>Like I said, the moment.JS stuff is hugely frustrating, because the docs are extensive, not well organized, and are tough to understand.  But that was the only real issue I had.  Getting the page to work w/ Firebase wasn't too tough.  Also, I always seem to have issues linking my logic to my HTML.  Dunno...</h5>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<h5>I wish I had the time to take a stab at the RPS game, but with Project One looming, I thought it best to get something done quickly and focus my efforts on the project.  If I have the time (and want the punishment), maybe I'll take a stab at it.</h5>
